# Rise of Industry Helper

This is the source code that powers the [Rise of Industry helper](https://3stan.github.io/roihelper/) website.

It currently has the following features:
* Allows the user to input a list of demanded items from towns and outputs:
  * How many units of each raw resource you will need to produce the demanded items
  * (roughly) How many buildings you will need to build to have a consistent production of said items.

This website is actively being worked on, feel free to message me on Discord (Tristan#3106) if you have any bug reports, comments or questions. I also hang out in the Rise of Industry Discord as well.
