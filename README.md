# Rise of Industry Helper

This is the source code that powers the [Rise of Industry helper](https://3stan.github.io/roihelper/) website.

It currently has the following features:
* Allows the user to input a list of demanded items from towns and outputs:
  * How many units of each raw resource you will need to produce the demanded items

This website is actively being worked on, feel free to message me on Discord (Tristan#3106) if you have any bug reports, comments or questions. I also hang out in the [Rise of Industry Discord](https://discord.gg/Q3XyYGM) as well.
